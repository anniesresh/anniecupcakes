<h1>How to Make: Vanilla Cupcakes with Buttercream Frosting</h1>
</div>
<p>Here is a beginner-friendly tutorial on how to bake delicious cupcakes:</p>




<h2>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h2>
<p>First, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients. For basic cupcakes, you'll need:</p>
<p class="groove">1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt
<br>
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
<br>
1 cup granulated sugar
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
<br>
1/2 cup milk</p>
<p>For chocolate cupcakes, you'll also need 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 2: Preheat Your Oven</h2>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a cupcake pan with paper liners.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 3: Mix Dry Ingredients</h2>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. If you're making chocolate cupcakes, sift in the cocoa powder as well.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 4: Cream Butter and Sugar</h2>
<p>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with a hand mixer or a stand mixer.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h2>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract</p>
<h2>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h2>
<p>Gradually mix in the dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cupcakes.</p>
<h2>Step 7: Fill Cupcake Liners</h2>
<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full. This will allow room for the cupcakes to rise while baking.</p>
<h2>Step 8: Bake</h2>
<p>Place the cupcake pan in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 9: Cool, Frost, and Decorate!</h2>
<p>Once baked, remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, you can frost them with your favorite frosting and decorate them as desired. Use piping bags and various tips to create fun designs on top of the cupcakes.</p>
<p>Once decorated, your cupcakes are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them at parties, gatherings, or simply enjoy them as a sweet treat anytime.</p>
